**Plan to learn the basics of jQuery**

* Find written tutorials by searching Google
    - Getting started with jQuery
    - jQuery essentials
    - jQuery quick tips
    - jQuery tutorial
* Find video tutorials on YouTube
    - Same type of search queries as on Google
    - Beginner's guide to jQuery
* With each of the learning sources I pick, I'll read it/watch it while taking a few notes. I'll test aspects of what I'm learning periodically between learning sources. I'll do some practice on [CodePen](https://codepen.io)
* Find a good jQuery "cheat sheet" if I haven't picked one out already
* With leftover time, go to Codeacademy or some other online learning site and make my way through challenges to solidify the basics and test what I've already learned.
* I plan to take a short 5-10 minute break after the first hour and then get right back into learning

**Study Reflection**

After doing some Google searches, I was able to slowly make my way through examples but I didn't feel like I was *really* learning jQuery. The best way for me to learn is to watch an instructor do it first and then I try it on my own code. I ended up learning the most from working through half of the course on [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com).

While working through the course, it guided me to the [jQuery documentation](http://api.jquery.com) which is a helpful resource for finding jQuery methods.

**Other Notes**

Common uses for jQuery:

1. FIND elements in an HTML document
2. CHANGE HTML content after page loads
3. LISTEN to what a user does and react accordingly
4. ANIMATE content on the page
5. TALK over the network to fetch new content

**Tell document to wait for HTML/CSS to load before running jQuery**

```
$(document).ready(function(){
    <code goes here>
});
```
