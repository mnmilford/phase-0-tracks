**Plan to learn the basics of jQuery**

* Find written tutorials by searching Google
    - Getting started with jQuery
    - jQuery essentials
    - jQuery quick tips
    - jQuery tutorial
* Find video tutorials on YouTube
    - Same type of search queries as on Google
    - Beginner's guide to jQuery
* With each of the learning sources I pick, I'll read it/watch it while taking a few notes. I'll test aspects of what I'm learning periodically between learning sources. I'll do some practice on [CodePen](codepen.io)
* Find a good jQuery "cheat sheet" if I haven't picked one out already
* With leftover time, go to Codeacademy or some other online learning site and make my way through challenges to solidify the basics and test what I've already learned.
* I plan to take a short 5-10 minute break after the first hour and then get right back into learning
